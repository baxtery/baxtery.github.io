#### Do I have to be a "hacker" to join?

No! Everyone is welcome to join!

* Hacking is **creative problem solving**.
* It does not have to involve technology.
* It's very beginner friendly.

#### But I'm really a complete beginner. Can I still come?

Of course! Check out [this great post](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/make-the-most-of-hackathon-season/)
by [Oleg](https://datalets.ch/) about getting started with hackathons.

The greater the diversity of backgrounds and skills,
the more awesome the solutions will be!

#### How much does it cost?

Nothing. It is totally free.

#### What is LoRaWAN?

It's a wireless technology, much like your regular WiFi, but it's ideal for IoT and battery
powered sensors because it has a huge range.

Head over to [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) website, and check out
the *LEARN* section and the forum.

#### What is civic tech?

It is technology that enables citizen engagement. It means citizens building infrastructure
for their city, instead of governments building it. That's what
[The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) communities are doing with LoRaWAN in
multiple cities of the world, among them, here in Zurich we are part of a community that has
already deployed a LoRaWAN network in the city.

#### What hardware will be available to use?

We will provide a selection of microcontrollers, sensors and components that we believe are
suitable for the challenges.

#### Do we get to keep the provided hardware?

**Yes**.

#### What should I bring to the event?

Bring your laptop and your ideas on how to improve your city!

Feel free to bring your own hardware (microcontroller, sensors, etc), designs, enclosures,
or whatever to help you create a solution for a challenge. The hardware provided is mostly
`3v3` in case you want to prepare something upfront.

#### Where can I get in touch with other participants?

On Slack! If you haven't joined already, [sign up for it](https://ttn-ch.herokuapp.com).
A large part of communication during the event will happen there!

#### How do I get to the location?

We recommend to use public transport to get to the event. The location is a
few steps away from train, tram and bus stations.

#### Is there a code of conduct?

Yes, [there is](/guidelines).

#### How can I contact the organizer if I have questions?
