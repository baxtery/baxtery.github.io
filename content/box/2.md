## Problem statement

**We know:**

* Forest area: 2232 hectares:
  * Around 642 forest entry points
  * 230 kilometer forest roads and paths
  * Diverse user groups:
      * Pedestrians (incl. Geocachers, Nordic Walkers)
      * Cyclists
      * Mountainbikers
      * Runners
      * Forest Kindergarten
      * Dog Owners

**We guess:**

* More than 1’500’000 visits per year

**We would like to know:**

* How many visitors do we have?
* Where do they go?
* Where do they stay?
* What activities do they perform?

**Why is this of interest?**

* Putting the right infrastructure in the right place
* Optimization of maintenance
* Early detection of trends
* Early detection of conflict areas
* Justification of resources

## Available Resources

* Data of available sensors (Pedestrians/Cyclists)
* Heatmap of Zurich: https://labs.strava.com/
* GIS Data:
  * Forest roads and paths
  * Forest entries
  * Recreation infrastructure in the forest (lines and points)

**Constraints:**

* Sensors (robust/energy source/wireless data transfer)
* Number of forest entries
* Accuracy/costs
* Data laws e.g. [Federal Act on Data Protection](https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html)

## Ideas & Hints

* Video evaluation
* Strava-App Data https://www.strava.com/features
* Other Apps?
* Mobile phone tracking
* Evaluation of App/Mobile-Data in small forest part, control with sensors => Optimization of infrastructure
* Extrapolation of data? Creation of a data model?
* Classification of visitors via movement speed?
* Creation of Heat-Map/Length of stay
