<!-- ## Problem statement

Today only 20% of our vehicles are equipped with counting sensors. The occupancy rate will be available days later. For future applications we need this information for all vehicles in real time. If the information of the occupancy rate is combined with the timetable, commuters may change their travel behavior and use less crowded vehicles.
